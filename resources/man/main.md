## What does Syncplay do?

Syncplay synchronises the position and 'play state' of multiple media players so that a group of people who all have the same video file can enjoy a shared viewing experience. This means that when one person pauses/unpauses playback or seeks (jumps position) within their media player then this will be replicated across all media players connected to the same server and in the same 'room' (viewing session).

## What does Syncplay not do?

Syncplay does not use video streaming or file sharing so each user must have their own copy of the media to be played. Syncplay does not synchronise player configuration, audio or subtitle track choice, volume or filters. Furthermore, users must manually choose what file to play as Syncplay does not synchronise which file is open. Finally, Syncplay does not provide a voice or text-based chat platform to allow for discussion during playback as Syncplay is intended to be used in conjunction with third-party communication solutions.

## What media players does Syncplay support?

Syncplay supports the latest version of `Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (MPC-HC)` on *Windows*, and `mplayer2` on *Windows* and *Linux*. See *[Instructions][1]* page for details on system requirements.

## Where can I get Syncplay?

See the *[Downloads][2]* page.

## How can I report bugs?

You can Syncplay report bugs through <https://github.com/Uriziel/syncplay/issues> but first please check to see if your problem has already been reported. If you are experiencing video playback issues then also check whether the problem still occurs without use of Syncplay, as it could be caused by your media player (and any associated codec, graphics card, configuration or driver issues) rather than Syncplay itself. You can also discuss your problem through Internet Relay Chat (IRC) via #syncplay on irc.rizon.net.
